# Mini Web Games

A collection of small, fun web-based games built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Next.js). This repository is a playground for experimenting with web development and game design concepts.

## ðŸ§© Games Included

The repository currently includes the following games:

1. Tic-Tac-Toe: A classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. You can also play against a bot with different difficulty levels.

2. 15 Puzzle: A sliding puzzle where players rearrange numbered tiles (1-15) on a 4x4 grid to arrange them in numerical order, using the empty space to shift tiles.

3. 2048: A single-player puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine tiles with the same numbers, aiming to create a tile with the value 2048.

4. Sudoku: A logic-based number placement puzzle where players fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all numbers without duplicates. The game starts with some cells pre-filled, and players must deduce the correct numbers to complete the grid.

> More games may be added in future updates.
